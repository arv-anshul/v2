I am building the ContentType Prediction System from scratch, this it is robuster, flexible and scalable.

- I have created custom `sklearn` transformers to transform the datasets. _But it is not that good._
- I also implemented the model monitoring part using abstraction classes. I do monitoring using `mlfow`.
- I also write scripts for the reference about how to monitor, train and predict models, through this I want to give you
  some idea that how does this pipeline works. _These scripts are for reference only._

## Custom Transformers Using `sklearn`

Yesterday, I have learned how to create a custom transformer using `sklearn` API.

I find it very useful and very elegant way to create pipelines with it. They are very simple to use and implement when
you get it right.

> [!INFO] A high level info about custom transformers.

> - Create a class which inherit two `sklearn` classes from `sklearn.base` module `TransformerMixin` and
>   `BaseEstimator`.
> - Now, you have to define `fit` and `transform` methods in your class.
> - And you are ready to use this custom transformer.
>
> Remember this is not a fully pleged custom class because there are numerous things you have to keep in mind while

## Monitoring With `mlflow`

**1st Draft**

I have think a custom monitoring pipeline where you pass the model and params with the training and testing set. Then it
calculate the score and log it with `mlflow`.
