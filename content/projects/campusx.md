description: This project involves gathering data from a course website's HTML structure, followed by developing Python
  scripts for parsing and extracting essential data. HTTP requests are then made to obtain session resources, with
  robust testing and data structure maintenance ensuring integrity. Then a web page is generated and hosted on GitHub
  Pages via CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
