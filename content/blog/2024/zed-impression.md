Zed is not just other code editor community is working on it continuously on it. I have been following Zed development
for a long time and I also trying it and also trying to understand its difference from Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

I have to say that Zed is \*\*\*king faster than VSCode. _**Yeh itna tez ki lagta hai ki slow karne ka koi setting hota
🫣.**_ But it's UI is not engaging as VSCode's because maybe because it has not all the essential features like
(rigorous) Syntax Highlighting, SCM UI Integration, Extension Support, etc. for now 😞.

I'm waiting for Zed to be ready so that I can use it daily without hesitation just like I use VSCode.
