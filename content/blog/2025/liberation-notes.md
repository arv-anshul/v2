I have been stuck in deciding whether should I pursue my Graduation or drop from it for Self-Study. It is like
mood-swings, one moment I think about dropping out and another I thought, should I really because I can do many thing
with my friends, even though college education doesn't gives me much?

| Pursue Graduation                                                   | Self-Study                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ❌                                                                  | ✅                                                                       |
| Make more good friends                                              | You are all responsible for any consequences                             |
| Make organic connections with interactions                          | You will be on yourself, no one is there to tell you what is good right. |
| Do something crazy with friends (first they need to teach themself) | Be discipline and learn alone                                            |
| Student benefits (Github, Google, etc.)                             | You can create something good everyday/everyweek                         |
| The degree and placement cushion after 4 years                      | You can learn and explore new things everyday/everyweek                  |
