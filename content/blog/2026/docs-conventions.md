I have zeal to follow best possible convention which is fool proof and best, yes best. I know this is a psychological
problem than a good habit.

Due to this I am not able to ship fast, I got strangled with best practice and conventions like proper formatting,
lifting, error handling, and more.

Although this helps me to learn a better specs but this blocks me from doing the things faster. I chase the best option
out there which is not good I guess.

For this I generally try to observe and tackle most of the by using opinionated tools like formatter and linter or by
defining conventions for myself.

## So What Are Docs Conventions?

1. Schema for every JSON and YAML files present in data directory.
2. Frontmatter schema for each and every doc file.
3. Manage UI components.

Important pages in my docs:

- `/`: Home page
- `/projects`: Page to display all projects.
- `/about`: To display all about me and my experiences.
- `/friends`:
- `/movies`:
- `/music`:
- `/resume`:
- `/blog`:
- `/diary`:
- `/diary/page`:
- `/diary/journal`:
