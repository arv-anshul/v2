YouTube randomly recommended me this video ([Podcast #3 by Arunesh Don](https://youtu.be/r-X74mUSUWY)) on my PC and it
instantly caught my attention (because of its channel name) but at that time I saved it into Watch Later playlist. Now
on 05 January at 02:30 AM I watched it. While watching I got some thoughts and also thought to email them to the Creator
but couldn't so I am writing it at evening.

## Thoughts

- **Beginning:** At start, I was thinking that this is just another video of an Indian student doing random shit with
  their friends. And it was, if you watch the video half way.
- **Observations:** I observed the narrator’s command in his surrounding, its not as usual as I thought it would be. In
  fact he has very grip on them the boys don’t argue, disgust, unnecessary laughing or making fun out of words which can
  happen many times in my case/scenario.
- **Surroundings:** I assume that the room in the video is of narrator’s and I have to say it is full of a mess but it
  has very motivating, inspiring, rebellious AURA too. Because the hostel room belongs to a B. Tech. student but it has
  geographical maps, motivational posters, and a poster written “SLAVE?” on it.
- **Interruption:** There was an interruption in the conversation which were having by someone who needs to do some
  photo-copy print. At first, he denied and told them to come after 30 minutes but eventually did the work. And in that
  process there was a guy who entered the room and get to his bed _(I assumed)_ to do something but the narrator
  instructed that guy “Don’t you read the instructions on the door?”. Then that guy instantly get out of the room and
  knock the door and enters _(that’s what I observe)_.
- **Ending:** In the end, there were almost two to four sentences which hits me and I also agree with them.
  1. While criticizing be a dominant, rigid, strict, confident person also maintain eye contact but while appreciation
     be a wise, gentle, clam person.
  2. Agar jo tu aaj hai, aur wahi cheez tu kal bhi follow karega to log tujhe predict kar lenge.
  3. Don't be only a lovable person, be a dominant one too.
  4. more...

## More insights on Arunesh

After the video finished, I started looking for his email id in channel's about section couldn't found it. Instead I
came to know about that his channel has almost 280+ videos which are from multiple topics like motivation, fraud
complains, criticism, etc. _(which is very bold, IMO)_. His videos focuses on self improvement and society improvement.
He is completely on different level, he is blunt and straight forward :saluting_face:.

> Although, I've got his email from one of his video _(mobile no. too)_ but I want to prepare to send an email.
>
> Will watch his other videos specially his podcast series.
