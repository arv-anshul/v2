I have already did the [review of my 2025 Journal](/journal/2025/00).

But that's the review of my Journal there are many things I haven't mentioned or even thought to write about. The things
like How I got into the College, and most important _(I even once thought about writing this)_ The Roller Coaster Life
in Bhopal.

Below are some points which I am able to remember while writing about Year 2025:

1. Ignoring LeapX internship in favor of 12th board exams, also not preparing for the exams.
2. 12th board exams completed in February and barely passed.
3. After the news, got panicked and started searching for college, even though before the result I don't want to go.
4. Eventually, I got admission via @Tanu with hell lot of drama, thrill, and suspense.
5. @Ankit also took admission there and now it's time to move to Bhopal.
6. Me and @Ankit both decided to move there one month prior of starting of new classes. Took train reservation of 3rd
   July.
7. That first month in Bhopal is fun and exciting, there is no pressure we are just waiting for college.
8. Then the college started and we made some very, very, very, good friends @Anurag, @Himanshu, @Diwas, @Ankush, and
   @Krish. We just met about a few weeks ago and its feel like that we are friends from childhood :).
9. As I was started to learn what and how does the college teach, its getting clearer that, this is not what I am here
   for. They are just revising the school routine _(even stricter)_. **"आसमान से गिरा, खजूर में अटका"**
10. There are many incident and story from the college and would not be good for this, so skipping.
11. As the time passes by, it's getting more prominent I am not going to survive this college environment. Whatever I've
    learned so far is not going evolve. Because I am not practicing, not learning, not even able to extract time for it
    and this frustrate me.
12. I discussed this situation with my parents and they said if you don't like it, don't do it, but make sure you are
    not making any mistakes.
13. At the end on 23rd December, I came home and confirmed that I am not going to dropping out and will learn and study
    from other sources.
14. Currently, I am in my house, on my bed, under the blanket, time: 09:55 AM.
