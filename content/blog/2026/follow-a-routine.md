Everyone has 24 hours in their days, but when you follow a routine you optimize thyself not only for that day in fact
for the others too.

As I am watching @emmytcnr [YT channel](https://youtube.com/@emmytcnr) I feel I should create a routine. Not so strict,
instead it will be like instructions to for me to what to do in the time you've got in that day.

It will be available in Google Notes with checkboxes.

The routine majorly consists of the things which are important and repetitive I want to do in a day. This will help to
keep track of them:

- Reminders like wake up time, exercises, time of sleep, book reading, coding timing, etc.
- Things you may want to prioritize.

This will help me to evaluate myself on daily basis, also makes me more disciplined.
