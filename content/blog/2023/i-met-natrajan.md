Today I realize that I again met another great guy @NatarajanLalgudi. He is just a amazing person. His style of talking,
way of understanding and his opinion on a data is just interesting and amazing.

He teaches me many things in just few days such as document your projects and share it with other which works as
marketing of yourself and I follow this advice and this works too. I learned a lot things from him.

We met while exchanging **Real Estate Datasets** which I scrapped from 99acres.com he said like you scrapped this
amazing data, you are amazing; you have to document this scrapping project and share with others also upload this data
on kaggle too with a proper documentation. So I did and it works well.

Today we connect on g-meet and he shows his works on the dataset and it looks fabulous I was just stun. He also suggest
me to market yourself by sharing your knowledge and these yours awesome projects and also participate in Kaggle
competitions which enhance your knowledge and it reflects on your CV too.

So I decided that I am going to move my focus from GitHub streak to Kaggle and Data Science concepts.

Thank You<br> Natarajan Sir
