   creating its HLD.

   next. _Just killing time on reels, web series and youtube._

## Week 07 Journal

1. Meeting with @Sagar and we discussed about:
   - Job applier on LinkedIn but he wants to apply from official website instead.
   - Suggested to look into [browser-use] tool which is apparently interesting and useful.
2. Explored [browser-use] it is interesting but there are some points to note:
   - Works on heavy prompting.
   - Very nice approach/feature of `Controller`.
   - As usual problem of LLM apps very dynamic in nature of completing tasks.
